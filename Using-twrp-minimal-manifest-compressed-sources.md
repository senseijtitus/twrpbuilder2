# Downloading

Download correct version of [Compressed Source](https://github.com/TwrpBuilder/twrp-sources/releases) i.e, don't try higher version then your stock rom unless you're using a custom kernel which supports the latest source. we commonly use 5.1 without repo for stable and debug builds.

# Setup

move source to home dir and type this command in terminal 

` tar -xvf omni_twrp-version-date-norepo.tar.xz`

Note: replace filename with yours
