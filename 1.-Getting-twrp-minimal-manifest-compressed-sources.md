## Downloading

Get the right version of [Compressed Source](https://github.com/TwrpBuilder/twrp-sources/releases) i.e. don't try higher version then your stock rom unless you're using a custom kernel which supports the latest source.
We commonly use **5.1 norepo** for stable and debug builds.

## Extracting

Run this in dir where you've saved the compressed source:

` tar -xvf omni_twrp-{version}-{date}-norepo.tar.xz --directory $HOME/twrp/`

### Note: 
- replace `omni_twrp-{version}-{date}-norepo.tar.xz` with the filename you've downloaded
- we assume `$HOME/twrp/` is your working dir for all this ****
